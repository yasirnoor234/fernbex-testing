Like the rest of Canada, Quebec\u2019s population is aging, and the birth rate is low, leading to large gaps in the provincial workforce.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.canadavisa.com\/assess\/canada-immigration-assessment-form.htm?utm_source=CICNews&amp;utm_medium=Article&amp;utm_campaign=CIC-20221004CAQ\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Discover if You Are Eligible for Canadian Immigration<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Immigration reforms during last term<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Immigration is a shared responsibility between the federal and provincial governments. However,&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.canadavisa.com\/quebec-skilled-immigration.html\">Quebec<\/a>&nbsp;is the only province in Canada that has complete control over the selection of economic immigrants. Over the past four years, the CAQ has prioritized immigrants from French-speaking countries in order to maintain Quebec\u2019s unique cultural status within Canada as the only francophone province.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Each year Quebec releases its own&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.canadavisa.com\/canada-immigration-levels-plans.html\">Immigration Levels Plan<\/a>&nbsp;that will set the target for the number of new immigrants that province is willing to invite. The 2022 plan calls for between 49,500 and 52,200 immigrants across all categories.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>With a maximum target of 33,900, the economic category represents the largest proportion of newcomers. In this category, the province expects to welcome up to 28,800 skilled workers and up to 4,300 business immigrants, which would include investors, entrepreneurs, and the self-employed.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Changing immigration targets<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Additionally, as a temporary measure to make up for not reaching 2020 targets, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.cicnews.com\/2021\/10\/quebec-sets-admissions-target-of-52500-immigrants-for-2022-1019420.html\">province committed to admitting a further 18,000 immigrant this year<\/a>. This means that by the end of 2022, Quebec could welcome more than 70,000 newcomers.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is a dramatic change from&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.cicnews.com\/2018\/12\/quebec-sets-admissions-target-of-40000-new-permanent-residents-for-2019-1211547.html\">CAQ\u2019s 2019 immigration levels plan<\/a>&nbsp;in which targets were reduced by 20% to improve the selection and francization of newcomers to Quebec.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Since CAQ lowered admission targets, the Quebec government has focused on the integration and francization of all new permanent residents by making significant investments in this area. For example, The budget for 2022-2023 cites investments of $290 million to increase support for immigrants to learn French, attract immigrants to regions outside Montreal, and expedite the processing of immigration applications.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Immigration reforms to come<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Legault has committed to allowing only 50,000 newcomers into Quebec a year throughout his term. He says this is the largest number of immigrants Quebec can accommodate as it is difficult to integrate newcomers into Quebec society, particularly those who need to learn French. One of the main pillars of the CAQ party is to protect the French language in Quebec.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The CAQ is also advocating for control over the selection of family class immigrants, who make up 11,000 of the immigrants Quebec plans to admit. Currently, the federal government decides who can immigrate as a family class immigrant and has refused to grant this power to Quebec.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Earlier this year, the CAQ introduced Bill-96, a law that limits the use of English in courts and public services in Quebec. The bill has faced criticism due to a clause stating that newcomers to Quebec are only able to access public services, such as hospitals, in English for six months after they arrive in the province.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The bill is currently being debated in the courts.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The CAQ places emphasis on the integration of French-speaking newcomers.
