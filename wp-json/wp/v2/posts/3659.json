In certain situations, however, the LMIA requirement can be waived if the person offers a significant benefit to Canada.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As a result, a\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.canadavisa.com\/labour-market-impact-assessments.html\">Labour Market Impact Assessment<\/a>\u00a0(LMIA) is generally required. The LMIA requirement, however, can be waived under a \u2018significant benefit\u2019 exemption. In such cases, the positive effects of the issuance of a\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.canadavisa.com\/working-in-canada.html\">work permit<\/a>,\u00a0would outweigh the potential negative consequences that could result from the standard procedure not being followed.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>These are cases for which an LMIA is usually required but practical considerations prevent this from being a possibility if Canada is to benefit, usually due to the lengthy processing times associated with most LMIAs. In such cases, aside from the lack of LMIA, the other factors that are typically considered when assessing a work permit application would mitigate in favour of the work permit being granted. Such factors include the potential impact on investment in Canada and the country\u2019s economy, the disruption of the Canadian labor market, as well as the needs of the Canadian consumer.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Criteria for a significant benefit work permit<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Foreign nationals looking to get a significant work permit in Canada must demonstrate to the Canadian government the work they will do will have\u00a0a significant economic, social, or cultural benefit to Canada.
