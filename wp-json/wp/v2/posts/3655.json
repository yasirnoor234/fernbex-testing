Last year\u2019s figure was higher to compensate for the lower figure in 2020. Due to the onset of the pandemic, IRCC only allowed 10,000 sponsors to apply for the&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.cicnews.com\/2020\/10\/what-do-you-need-to-be-eligible-for-the-pgp-2020-1016018.html#gs.e0ie97\">PGP in 2020<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">2021 Census Report<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Every five years Statistics Canada releases detailed data on immigration.

The&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.cicnews.com\/2022\/07\/express-entry-canada-expected-to-invite-fswp-and-cec-candidates-today-0726782.html#gs.e0lucr\">initial draw on July 6<\/a>&nbsp;invited 1,500 candidates to apply for permanent residence, with a minimum&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.canadavisa.com\/express-entry-comprehensive-ranking-system.html\">Comprehensive Ranking System<\/a>&nbsp;score of 557.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Since July 6, the minimum CRS has been steadily decreasing with each draw. The first five draws had declines of 8 or 9 points and the two most recent draws on&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.cicnews.com\/2022\/09\/canada-holds-sixth-all-program-express-entry-draw-since-july-0930714.html#gs.e0lzjn\">September 14<\/a>&nbsp;and 28 had decreased of only 6 points in each draw. The&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.cicnews.com\/2022\/09\/canada-invites-candidates-in-the-most-recent-express-entry-draw-0931156.html#gs.e0lr1w\">most recent score on September 28<\/a>&nbsp;was 504. If this trend continues, the score could soon dip below 500 for an all-program draw for the first time since the draw on December 23, 2020, when the CRS score was 468.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>While the score is slowly decreasing, compared to draws before the pandemic, 504 is still a remarkably high. A typical draw before the pandemic would have a CRS score between 450 and 500 points.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As the CRS score continues to lower, the number of ITAs has also been increasing with each draw. Again, the first several draws saw an increase of 250 candidates with each draw until the most recent three draws in which the number of ITA\u2019s has jumped by 500 each draw. All-program draws in 2020 before the pandemic invited between 3,400- 4,500 candidates each time.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Immigration Levels Plan 2023-2025<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Each year IRCC issues an&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.canadavisa.com\/canada-immigration-levels-plans.html\">Immigration Levels Plan<\/a>&nbsp;to act as the guideline for the number of immigrants that will be allowed to come to Canada each year. It includes the breakdown of immigrants from economic class, family class and humanitarian class programs over the next three years.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This year it looks like IRCC is poised to set more record-breaking targets. The target for 2022 is nearly 432,000 new permanent residents and over 451,000 by 2024.&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.canadavisa.com\/canadas-immigration-minister.html\">Immigration Minister Sean Fraser<\/a>&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.canadavisa.com\/canada-immigration-levels-plans.html\">told&nbsp;<em>CIC News<\/em>&nbsp;in June<\/a>&nbsp;that he can foresee higher targets in the coming years, up to 500,000 new permanent residents, but he did not specify when that would happen. It is unlikely the target will decrease given Canada\u2019s current labour shortage and&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.cicnews.com\/2022\/09\/canadian-job-vacancies-have-reached-another-all-time-high-0930962.html#gs.e0mfd1\">high number of job vacancies<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to the Immigration Refugees Protection Act (IRPA), IRCC has a deadline of November 1 to release the new plan but as Parliament is sitting for four consecutive weeks after Canadian Thanksgiving, it is possible that the plan may come a few days sooner. IRPA is the main piece of legislation that regulates Canadian immigration.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>IRCC works with other governmental departments and stakeholders to create an Immigration Levels Plan that is balanced in how permanent resident\u2019 spots are distributed among each immigration class, and from there further organized into how many spots per program.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The next month will hold announcements for the Parents and Grandparents Program, Immigration Levels Plan 2023-2025, Statistics Canada census data and more.
