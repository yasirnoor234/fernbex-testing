<h4 class="wp-block-heading">You still have more steps to complete after submitting your application for Canadian immigration under the spousal and common-law sponsorship program.</h4>



<p>After you apply to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.canadavisa.com/spousal-and-common-law-partner-sponsorship.html">sponsor your spouse or common-law partner</a>&nbsp;for Canadian immigration, you may wish to track the progress of your application, update your application, or otherwise communicate with&nbsp;<a href="https://www.canadavisa.com/ircc.html">Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada</a>&nbsp;(IRCC). There are also some important steps you must take before you can finally become a permanent resident of Canada.</p>



<p>After applying you could be waiting a long time for permanent residency. The processing standard for new spousal sponsorship applications is 12 months. However, IRCC’s own&nbsp;<a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/application/check-processing-times.html">processing time calculator</a>&nbsp;is estimating&nbsp;<a href="https://www.canadavisa.com/inland-spousal-common-law-partner-sponsorship.html">inland applications</a>&nbsp;are taking an average of 15 months, and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.canadavisa.com/outland-spousal-common-law-partner-sponsorship.html">outland applicants</a>&nbsp;are taking about 24 months.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.cic.gc.ca/english/helpcentre/answer.asp?qnum=1474&amp;top=3">IRCC’s webpage</a>&nbsp;states that processing begins on the day your complete application is received. When officials determine that your submitted application is complete, you will get an acknowledgement of receipt (AOR) and an application number. IRCC says on its webpage that it has been taking a long time to issue AORs due to the COVID-19 pandemic. If IRCC officials will return your application if it is incomplete or fees are missing.</p>



<p>Here is what you can expect between the time you submit your application and the time you officially become a Canadian permanent resident.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Sponsors</h3>



<p>IRCC will first examine the Canadian sponsor’s eligibility. If all the forms and documents are present, IRCC will send an email or letter confirming that the application has been accepted for processing. IRCC will then asses the sponsor’s eligibility and send an email or letter containing the decision.</p>



<p>If the sponsorship undertaking is approved, IRCC will send the application for permanent residence to the appropriate processing office. IRCC will then decide whether the person being sponsored is eligible for&nbsp;<a href="https://www.canadavisa.com/canadian-immigration-visas.html">permanent residence</a>.</p>



<p>If the undertaking is refused, IRCC will explain why in an email or letter.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Quebec residents</h3>



<p>If you live in Quebec and are applying for spousal sponsorship, the foreign spouse must complete and sign the Demande de sélection permanente – Catégorie du regroupement familial (Application for permanent selection – Family reunification class) form. This document must be enclosed with the sponsor’s undertaking application to the Quebec government.</p>



<p>If the Government of Quebec approves the undertaking application, they will send IRCC the information needed to process your permanent residency application.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Applicants</h3>



<p>Once the Canadian spouse or common-law partner is found to be eligible, IRCC will send you (or your authorized representative) an AOR with your application number on it.</p>



<p>The application number allows you to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/application/account/link-paper-online.html">link your application</a>&nbsp;to your IRCC secure account. This way, couples can communicate with IRCC and get updates and messages about their application online.</p>



<p>During the processing, IRCC will ask you to submit your:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list"><li>medical exams;</li><li>police certificates; and</li><li>biometrics.</li></ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Medical exams</h3>



<p>All foreign national family members (who are not already a Canadian citizen or permanent resident) need to pass a medical exam, even if they are not applying to come to Canada with you. IRCC says failure to declare and have family members examined will affect your application, and your ability to sponsor them in the future.</p>



<p>IRCC will send you and each family member a request to complete a medical exam at an appropriate time in processing. It will contain instructions about what to do. You might not receive it right after applying, as medical results expire and IRCC might ask you to do them at a later time to reduce the chance of having to redo a medical exam.</p>



<p>If you have already completed an immigration medical exam, you must provide details in the “medical examination” section of your document checklist. Depending on when the exam was done, you may have to do it again.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="police_cert">Police certificates</h3>



<p>Immigration applicants age 18 years of age and older must provide a valid police certificate for any country other than Canada in which you spent six or more months in a row since the age of 18.</p>



<p>If the original certificate isn’t in English or French, you must get an accredited translator to translate it and include both the police certificate and the original copy of the translation.</p>



<p>IRCC will also do its own background checks to see if there are reasons why you or your family members may not be admissible to Canada.</p>



<p>For more specific and up-to-date information, IRCC offers a guide on&nbsp;<a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/application/medical-police/where.html">where to get a police certificate</a>.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Biometrics</h3>



<p>When the biometrics fee is paid, IRCC will send your family members a letter asking them to give their biometrics. Family members must show this letter when they give their biometrics. They have 30 days to give their biometrics in person at their closest collection point. IRCC recommends booking biometrics appointments as soon as possible to avoid delays.</p>



<p>IRCC will send instructions to let your family members know how much time they have to send in their biometrics.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Open work permits for inland sponsorship applicants</h3>



<p>If you are applying for immigration from within Canada, you may be eligible for the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.canadavisa.com/inland-spousal-common-law-sponsorship-open-work-permit-pilot-program.html">Spousal Open Work Permit</a>. This work permit allows you to work anywhere in Canada while your permanent residency application is in processing. You can either submit your application for an open work permit together with your application for permanent residence, or after you apply.</p>



<p>IRCC says the application for an open work permit is normally processed in four months.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Interview</h3>



<p>If an interview is needed, IRCC will tell you in writing. IRCC will give you the date, time and location of the interview, and provide you a list of documents to bring.</p>



<p>During an interview, an officer may ask you, the principal applicant, about your:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list"><li>relationship with the sponsor</li><li>education level</li><li>reasons for immigrating</li><li>plans and preparations</li><li>family</li><li>health</li><li>financial situation</li><li>past difficulties with the law</li></ul>



<p>IRCC may also ask questions that will be used to evaluate your means to settle in Canada.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Once PR is approved</h3>



<p>To allow IRCC to finish processing the application once it is approved, you need to send in the following documents for all who are immigrating to Canada, including any dependent children:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list"><li>passports or photocopies of passports (IRCC will let you know which)</li><li>two photos</li><li>proof of payment for the right of permanent residency fee, if it hasn’t already been sent.</li></ul>



<p>IRCC will let you know where to send this information.</p>



<p>If the spouse being sponsored or any dependents are outside Canada, IRCC will send them a Confirmation of Permanent Residence (COPR) and a permanent resident visa (if required) once their application is finished processing. Once received, you will be able to travel to Canada and meet an officer at a Canadian port of entry before these documents expire. The officer will make the final decision to allow your family members to enter Canada as permanent residents.</p>



<p>If you are inside Canada, you have to meet an immigration officer to receive your COPR. IRCC will send you a letter to schedule your appointment and tell you what documents to bring. The officer will make the final decision on your permanent residency application.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">If you receive an order to leave the country, you may have the option to return at a later date.</h4>



<p>Canada has the authority to ask non-Canadian citizens to leave the country by issuing removal orders. Removal orders are often issued if you have committed an illegal act while in Canada. You could also get one if you are found to be working without a valid visa or otherwise violating the conditions of your visa. If you have received a removal order, you must leave Canada within 30 days and you will likely need an&nbsp;<a href="https://www.canadavisa.com/authorization-to-return-to-canada.html">Authorization to Return to Canada</a>&nbsp;(ARC) should you wish to return at some point in the future.</p>



<p>An ARC is an official document that gives you permission to enter Canada again after a specified length of time. There are cases when it may not be necessary to obtain one if you follow the guidelines set out by the government. There are three types of removal orders. The category of removal order you receive will dictate the steps you need to take to return to Canada.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Departure order</h3>



<p>A departure order will ask that you leave Canada by a certain date, often 30 days after issue. It will not limit if or when you can return. If you need to return to Canada at any point, it is important to leave by the deadline and, upon leaving, inform a Canadian immigration office of your departure so they may verify that you have left. If you overstay in Canada, which will be the assumption if you do not confirm your departure with an officer, your departure order becomes a deportation order, which is far more serious.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Exclusion Order</h3>



<p>An exclusion order means that you need to leave Canada and you may not return for 12 months. If you comply with the order by leaving within the deadline and remaining outside Canada for a year, in addition to receiving a certificate of departure by confirming your departures with Canadian authorities, you do not need an ARC. Like a departure order, if you overstay the date on the exclusion order you will be issued a deportation order.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Deportation Order</h3>



<p>A deportation order is the most serious type of removal order. It means that you must leave Canada and you are not allowed to return throughout your life. Anyone who has received a deportation order and wishes to come back must get an ARC.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">How to get an ARC</h3>



<p>To get an ARC, you must apply at the same time as you apply for a work or study permit in Canada. If you are from a visa-exempt country, you need to apply for just the ARC on its own. To apply for an ARC and visa, you will need to include all the required documents for your visa as well as:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list"><li>two passport size photographs taken within the last six months.</li><li>a copy of your passport.</li><li>a written letter (in English or French) explaining, in detail, the reasons you feel you should be allowed to return to Canada. The letter must be written in block letters in black ink or typed.</li><li>the processing fee ($400 CAD).</li></ul>



<p>If you did not leave Canada in the specified amount of time as stated on a departure order or an exclusion order, and you now have a deportation order, your written statement must include the reason you did not comply with dates.</p>



<p>You may be asked for an interview so officials can inquire about your current circumstances and why you wish to return to Canada.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Eligibility for an ARC</h3>



<p>ARCs are often subject to the decision of the immigration officer who reviews your application. They will be looking at why you were asked to leave Canada the first time. You may have received a removal order due to circumstances such as committing an illegal act or working without a visa. It can also work against you to be unemployed or unable to demonstrate strong ties to your home country.</p>



<p>If you were issued a removal order due to a criminal act, you may also need to submit proof of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.canadavisa.com/immigration-criminality-rehabilitation.html">criminal rehabilitation</a>.</p>



<p>If you have fulfilled the terms of your removal order and need to return to Canada, apply for your ARC as soon as possible. There is no service standard and it may take extra time for IRCC to decide.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Canada plans to welcome over 450,000 newcomers by 2024.</h4>



<p>Canada’s high standard of living and a global reputation for safety and stability make it a popular destination for South Africans seeking a new home abroad. Canada is always on the lookout for global talent to make up for a growing labour shortage in several sectors. This is largely due to Canada’s aging population and low birth rate.</p>



<p>Canada offers over 100 immigration pathways for those who are looking to start the next phase of their life and seeks to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.canadavisa.com/canada-immigration-levels-plans.html">welcome over 450,000 new permanent residents</a>&nbsp;by the end of 2024. Some pathways are more popular than others and it’s a good idea to get familiar with them so you can decide if they are the best option for you and your family.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Express Entry</h3>



<p>Most skilled workers who immigrate to Canada come through&nbsp;<a href="https://www.canadavisa.com/express-entry.html">Express Entry</a>, which is an application management system that works with three programs; the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.canadavisa.com/federal-skilled-worker-program-fswp.html">Federal Skilled Worker Program</a>&nbsp;(FSWP), the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.canadavisa.com/canada-federal-skilled-trades-program-fstc.html">Federal Skilled Trades Program</a>&nbsp;(FSTP) and the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.canadavisa.com/canadian-experience-class.html">Canadian Experience Class</a>&nbsp;(CEC). These programs aim to assess a candidate’s qualifications based on specific criteria and rank them alongside other candidates using the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.canadavisa.com/express-entry-comprehensive-ranking-system.html">Comprehensive Ranking System</a>&nbsp;(CRS).</p>



<p>CRS scores are based on factors such as education, language ability, work experience and other human capital factors such as age. The higher the CRS score, the more likely a candidate is to receive an invitation to apply (ITA) for permanent residency. Language ability is one of the most influential factors in a CRS score. This can give South Africans an advantage as the English is one of the official languages of Canada.</p>



<p>The first step for those who are interested in an Express Entry program is for a candidate to self-evaluate if they are eligible for one of the programs and uploads their profile on the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.canadavisa.com/ircc.html">Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada</a>&nbsp;(IRCC) website. Once a profile is complete, candidates will get their CRS score and be ranked against other candidates in Express Entry pool.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Federal Skilled Worker Program (FSWP)</h3>



<p>Of all Express Entry programs, the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.canadavisa.com/federal-skilled-worker-program-fswp.html">Federal Skilled Worker Program</a>&nbsp;is the most popular pathway for those who have work experience and education outside of Canada and wish to immigrate permanently. It was the first program in the world to feature a points system designed to evaluate candidates impartially and has been the basis for similar programs in other countries.</p>



<p>The first step to becoming a FSWP candidate is to self-evaluate if you meet the minimum eligibility requirements:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list"><li>At least one year of skilled work experience</li><li>A minimum Canadian Language Benchmark of 7 on their English or French language test</li><li>At least one educational credential</li><li>Demonstrate proof of funds (if applicable)</li><li>Get at least 67 out of 100 points on the FSWP scoring grid</li></ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">What to do if you are eligible</h3>



<p>If you are eligible for the FSWP, you can create a profile on the IRCC website. Once your profile has been uploaded, you will receive your CRS score and enter the pool.</p>



<p>IRCC&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cicnews.com/2022/07/express-entry-canada-expected-to-invite-fswp-and-cec-candidates-today-0726782.html#gs.8qhjf1">resumed Express Entry draws on July 6</a>&nbsp;this year. The draws, in which the candidates with the highest CRS scores are issued an ITA, typically occur every two weeks. The CRS score changes with every draw so even if you are not invited in one draw, you may still be invited in the next. IRCC has a processing standard of six months for 80% of all Express Entry applications.</p>



<p>If you receive an ITA, you will have 60 days to submit your application for permanent residence to IRCC.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Provincial nomination programs (PNP)</h3>



<p>Along with Express Entry,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.canadavisa.com/provincial-nomination-program.html">the PNP</a>&nbsp;is among the two major ways to immigrate to Canada through the economic class. All provinces, except for&nbsp;<a href="https://www.canadavisa.com/quebec-skilled-immigration.html">Quebec</a>&nbsp;and Nunavut, have Provincial Nominee Programs (PNPs). These programs allow provincial governments to select the candidates they feel are the best fit for the province.</p>



<p>Provinces can invite candidates from the Express Entry pool who they feel best suit the province to apply directly to the provincial government for nomination, a process known as enhanced nomination. Candidates who may not be in the Express Entry pool can submit an application to directly to the province to be considered.</p>



<p>Provincial nomination can act as a huge boost for Express Entry as those who obtain a provincial nomination are automatically given 600 CRS points and become highly likely to receive an ITA.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Conclusion</h3>



<p>Canada enjoys one of the highest standards of living in the world and is overall an extremely safe country for newcomers. South Africans wishing to immigrate to Canada are in an advantageous position as a shared language makes it more likely they will get a high CRS score and anyone from around the globe might benefit from Canada’s increasingly high targets for permanent residents.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">ICTs are designed to facilitate transfers for employees of multi-national companies.</h4>



<p>Multi-national companies that have parent, branch, subsidiary, or affiliate companies in Canada may be eligible to send employees to Canada with an&nbsp;<a href="https://www.canadavisa.com/intra-company-transfer-program.html">Intra-Company Transfer</a>&nbsp;(ICT) without needing to obtain a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.canadavisa.com/labour-market-impact-assessments.html">Labour Market Impact Assessment</a>&nbsp;(LMIA).</p>



<p>LMIAs can be costly and time consuming so not needing to get an LMIA is one of the biggest benefits of an ICT. For example, in order to get an LMIA businesses need to demonstrate that bringing in an employee from a foreign country will not have a negative impact on the local labour force or economy.</p>



<p>ICT permits are initially valid for up to three years. After that, it is possible to renew for up to five years for specialized knowledge holders and seven years for executives and senior managers.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Employer requirements</h3>



<p>A company is only eligible to take advantage of ICT work permits if they are operating in Canada. Canadian and foreign locations need to provide goods and services. Simply having a physical presence or office in Canada will not suffice.</p>



<p>There are, however, some exceptions made for start-ups. If a company is trying to transfer a senior manager or executive,<a href="https://www.canadavisa.com/ircc.html">&nbsp;Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada</a>&nbsp;(IRCC) may acknowledge that the start-up address is not secured yet, and the company may be allowed to use its lawyer’s Canadian address until a location is leased or purchased.</p>



<p>A start-up must be able to demonstrate a tangible and realistic plan to staff their new operation in Canada. They need to be financially able to start and maintain the business as well as pay employees.</p>



<p>If the transferee is an executive or a manager, the company needs to show that it is large enough to require, and support, executive or management functions.</p>



<p>In many instances, a worker is transferred because of their specialized knowledge. If this is the case, the company needs to make sure that the employee is directed by management at the Canadian branch instead of being overseen from abroad.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Transferee requirements</h3>



<p>An employee may be eligible to apply for an ICT work permit if they meet certain criteria.</p>



<p>To begin with, they must be an employee of a multi-national company that has a parent, subsidiary, branch or affiliate in Canada, and they must be being transferred to a position as an executive, senior manager, or in a specialized knowledge capacity.</p>



<p>They must also have been employed continuously with the company for at least one year out of the three-year period immediately before the date of the initial application. Also, they must only intend to stay in Canada temporarily and comply with all the immigration requirements for temporary entry.</p>



<p>It may also be possible to obtain an ICT if the transferee has not had full-time work experience with the company. Immigration officers may consider the number of years of work experience the applicant has had on a part-time basis, or the number of positions within the company.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">CUSMA</h3>



<p>It is also possible to get an intra-company transfer through the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.canadavisa.com/nafta-work-permits.html">Canada-United States-Mexico Agreement</a>&nbsp;(CUSMA). This is another option that does not require a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.canadavisa.com/labour-market-impact-assessments.html">Labour Market Impact Assessment</a>.</p>



<p>This program facilitates increased movement for employees of North American companies. Like ICT’s, the transferee must have worked continuously for their employer in the U.S. or Mexico for a year over the past three years at the time of applying.</p>



<p>In order for a transferee to be eligible for an ICT under CUSMA, they need to be employed at the time of application and doing similar work in their foreign job as they will be doing when they arrive in Canada.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">IRCC will now allow physicians who are already in Canada to apply for PR under Express Entry programs.</h4>



<p>As Canada continues to experience a nation-wide shortage of qualified physicians,<a href="https://www.canadavisa.com/ircc.html">&nbsp;Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada</a>&nbsp;(IRCC) has made changes that will exempt physicians already in Canada as temporary residents from some of the current requirements involved in obtaining permanent resident status through&nbsp;<a href="https://www.canadavisa.com/express-entry.html">Express Entry</a>&nbsp;programs.</p>



<p>Most notably, physicians who are already working in Canada often find themselves unable to qualify for Express Entry because doctors in Canada often use a “fee-for-service” payment model that is different than the traditional employer-employee relationship. On paper, this means many physicians who are currently in Canada as temporary residents are considered self-employed.</p>



<p>Self-employed individuals, who gain this experience within Canada, are not eligible for most economic immigration pathways, such as those offered under Express Entry. It is important to note that being self-employed on its own does not render a candidate ineligible. If a candidate has gained at least one year of work experience abroad, or as an employee in Canada, they may still be eligible for an Express Entry program.</p>



<p>Immigration Minister Sean Fraser says removing this barrier will act as a signal to physicians that they are welcome to stay in Canada. While in New Glasgow, Nova Scotia, last week he spoke positively about the new measure.</p>



<p>“In my home province in particular, foreign-born physicians have been helping to keep families healthy and to take care of our aging population,’ said Fraser. “Their skills are critical resources in our community, and it does not take long before they become our neighbours, friends, and fellow community leaders. Physicians resettling here in Nova Scotia or in other parts across the country is a win-win situation. The measures announced today signal to these physicians that we want them to stay, by making it easier for them to choose Canada as their permanent home.”</p>



<p>The measure is another attempt by IRCC to attract and retain physicians and other healthcare workers. As of June 2022, approximately 4,300 permanent residents were admitted under the health care streams of the time-limited&nbsp;<a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/immigrate-canada/tr-pr-pathway.html">Temporary Residence to Permanent Residence pathway</a>.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Nationwide shortage of healthcare workers</h3>



<p>Canada currently has a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cicnews.com/2022/09/canadian-job-vacancies-have-reached-another-all-time-high-0930962.html#gs.du8au1">job vacancy rate of nearly 6% in the healthcare sector</a>. This means that in the second quarter of 2022, there were over 136,000 healthcare professions that needed to be filled across the country. Manitoba has the highest vacancy rate at 6.7%.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/campaigns/immigration-matters/growing-canada-future/health.html">Data from IRCC suggests</a>&nbsp;that one in four healthcare workers in Canada is an immigrant. This includes 36% of physicians. The same data highlights that there are nearly 500,000 workers in the health-care sector that are over the age of 55 and therefore will hit retirement age, 65, in the coming decade. To combat this shortage, and shortages across all sectors, Canada’s&nbsp;<a href="https://www.canadavisa.com/canada-immigration-levels-plans.html">Immigration Levels Plan</a>&nbsp;is targeting the highest ever numbers of new permanent residents across all lines business. Most newcomers will come from economic class programs.</p>



<p>So far in 2022 IRCC has accepted over 8,600 temporary and permanent resident applications from foreign nationals intending to work in the health sector.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Changes coming in Express Entry</h3>



<p>The exception for physicians signals the start of changes in Express Entry that can be expected to continue into 2023. Last June, Bill C-19 received Royal Assent in Parliament, and will give IRCC more authority to target&nbsp;<a href="https://www.canadavisa.com/express-entry.html">Express Entry</a>&nbsp;candidates who have specific work experience, education, or language abilities, rather than issuing invitations to apply to a wider range of candidates based solely on their CRS scores, as is currently the norm.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.cicnews.com/2022/06/immigration-minister-sean-fraser-discusses-express-entry-reforms-0626504.html#gs.du8ewx">Fraser told&nbsp;<em>CIC News</em>&nbsp;in an interview in June</a>&nbsp;that the new authorities will allow Canada to invite candidates who are already primed for success in the labour market and will therefore be better placed to contribute to Canada’s economy, rather than overloading already robust labour sectors with new applicants.</p>



<p>“If you’re in a circumstance where you have an abundance of applications that are all in one particular sector, and that sector doesn’t have high needs in Canada the Express Entry system as it exists today, is likely to bring in people that might not be perfectly matched to the needs of the Canadian economy,” said Fraser.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Express Entry</h3>



<p><a href="https://www.canadavisa.com/express-entry.html">Express Entry</a>&nbsp;is an application management system that uses a points-based system, the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.canadavisa.com/express-entry-comprehensive-ranking-system.html">Comprehensive Ranking System</a>&nbsp;(CRS), to rank candidates’ profiles in the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.canadavisa.com/federal-skilled-worker-program-fswp.html">Federal Skilled Worker Program</a>, the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.canadavisa.com/canada-federal-skilled-trades-program-fstc.html">Federal Skilled Trades Program</a>, or the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.canadavisa.com/canadian-experience-class.html">Canadian Experience Class</a>. The top-scoring candidates receive an&nbsp;<a href="https://www.canadavisa.com/express-entry-invitation-to-apply-for-permanent-residence.html">Invitation to Apply</a>&nbsp;(ITA) and can then apply for permanent residence. IRCC has a processing standard of six months for new Express Entry applications.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">International students and their spouses or partners may be eligible to work during their studies.</h4>



<p>An international student in Canada may be eligible to work in Canada while studying as long as their&nbsp;<a href="https://www.canadavisa.com/canadian-temporary-study-visa.html">study permit</a>&nbsp;includes a condition that says they can work on or off campus. The student may only start working once they begin studying and must all meet all the other eligibility requirements.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Off-campus work rules</h3>



<p>A student may be eligible to work for an employer that is not located on the campus of the educational institution where they are registered. If the student is eligible, they may only work up to 20 hours per week during regular academic semesters, and full-time during scheduled academic breaks, like winter, spring and summer break.</p>



<p>In order to be eligible to work off campus, an international student must:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list"><li>hold a valid study permit</li><li>be studying full time at a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.canadavisa.com/designated-learning-institution-list.html">Designated Learning Institution</a>&nbsp;(DLI)</li><li>have started studying and remain in satisfactory academic standing as determined by their institution</li><li>be studying in an academic, vocational or professional training program that is at least six months in duration and leads to a certificate, diploma or degree</li><li>have a social insurance number (SIN)</li></ul>



<p>If a student’s situation changes during their time working and they no longer meet any of the above eligibility requirements, they must stop working off-campus.</p>



<p>If a student is no longer studying full time, they may be able to continue working off-campus if they:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list"><li>were registered as a full-time student since the beginning of the study program in Canada,</li><li>are now studying part time because it is the last semester of their study program, and a full-time course schedule is no longer required to finish the program.</li></ul>



<p>Students that are not eligible to work off campus include:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list"><li>students enrolled in an English as a Second Language (ESL) or French as a Second Language (FSL) program</li><li>students taking a general interest course or program</li><li>visiting or exchange students at a designated learning institution</li><li>students only taking courses required to be accepted into a full-time program</li><li>students taking an authorized leave from their studies</li><li>students switching schools and aren’t currently studying</li></ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">On-campus work rules</h3>



<p>A student may be eligible to work within the campus of where they are registered as long as the student meets certain eligibility criteria. They must:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list"><li>hold a valid study permit</li><li>have a social insurance number (SIN)</li><li>be registered as a full time post-secondary student at a public post-secondary school (such as a college or university), a private college level school in Quebec that operates under the same rules as public schools and is 50% funded by government grants, or a Canadian private school that can legally award degrees under provincial law.</li></ul>



<p>On-campus work means working for an employer located on the grounds of the educational institution where the student is enrolled. The employment can be for:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list"><li>the school,</li><li>a faculty member,</li><li>a student organization,</li><li>a private business on campus,</li><li>a private contractor providing services to the school, or</li><li>self-employed on-campus.</li></ul>



<p>Moreover, if a student is working as a teaching or research assistant or if the work is directly related to a research grant, the student may work at a library, hospital or research facility associated with the school, even if the location is not on campus.</p>



<p>Students that are not eligible to work on campus include:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list"><li>students who stop studying full time, unless they are in their final semester and meet other requirements</li><li>students whose study permit has expired</li><li>students taking an authorized leave from their studies</li><li>students switching schools and aren’t currently studying</li></ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Co-op rules</h3>



<p>A student who is studying at a DLI in Canada and requires a mandatory work placement or internship must apply for a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.canadavisa.com/co-op-work-permits.html">co-op or intern work permit</a>&nbsp;in addition to a valid study permit.</p>



<p>The co-op work permit is a separate, closed-work permit. It may only be used for work that is essential to the program of study. Work experience that is considered essential to the program of study is work undertaken for program credits and is required in order for the student to graduate.</p>



<p>Students may have a standard work authorization granted by their student permit as well as a co-op work permit, meaning they can simultaneously have a job unrelated to their study program and be working in a mandatory work placement.</p>



<p>Students may be eligible to apply for a co-op work permit if they:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list"><li>hold a valid study permit</li><li>are enrolled in a study program that requires mandatory work placement in order to obtain credits for the program</li><li>have a letter from the educational institution authorizing the work placement, and confirming that the work placement is required for the study program</li></ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">How your partner can work</h3>



<p>The spouse or common-law partner of an international student may be eligible for an open work permit if the student:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list"><li>holds a valid study permit</li><li>is eligible for a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.canadavisa.com/post-graduation-work-permit-program.html">Post-Graduation Work Permit</a>&nbsp;(PGWP)</li><li>is a full-time student at one of these types of schools: a public post-secondary school, a private college level school in Quebec or a Canadian private school that can legally award degree under provincial law.</li></ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">How to work after you graduate</h3>



<p>Once the student graduates, they may be able to obtain a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.canadavisa.com/post-graduation-work-permit-program.html">Post-Graduation Work Permit</a>&nbsp;(PGWP). The PGWP is an open work permit, allowing the holder to work for an employer of their choice and is valid for up to three years.</p>



<p>In order to be eligible for a PGWP, the international student must meet the following criteria:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list"><li>completed studies in an academic, vocational or professional training program that is at least eight months long at a DLI</li><li>study program must have led to a degree, diploma or certificate</li><li>held full-time student status in Canada during every academic semester of the program of study completed and included as part of the PGWP application</li><li>received a transcript and an official letter from the eligible DLI confirming that the applicant has met the requirements to complete their program of study</li></ul>



<p>The student must also have graduated from one of the following:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list"><li>a public post-secondary institution,</li><li>a private post-secondary school, a private secondary or post-secondary school in Quebec that offers programs that result in the issuance of a diplôme d’études professionnelles (DEP) or an attestation de spécialisation professionnelle (ASP), or</li><li>a Canadian private school that can award degrees under provincial law (for example, Associate, Bachelor’s, Master’s or Doctorate degree) but only if the student was enrolled in a study program that leads to a degree as authorized by the province.</li></ul>



<p>The major benefit of the PGWP is that international graduates can gain professional work experience in Canada, which is helpful when they go on to apply for Canadian immigration. In general, a PGWP holder needs to gain one year of professional work experience in a National Occupational Classification (NOC) code of 0, A or B to be eligible for a Canadian permanent residence program.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">The CAQ places emphasis on the integration of French-speaking newcomers.</h4>



<p>The Coalition Avenir Québec (CAQ) has secured its second consecutive win under the leadership of Francois Legault.</p>



<p>The CAQ was named the winning party only eleven minutes after polls closed. The party made major gains this election, increasing the number of seats it holds in Quebec’s National Assembly from 76 to 90. It is the strongest majority government&nbsp;<a href="https://www.canadavisa.com/quebec-skilled-immigration.html">Quebec</a>&nbsp;has had since a Liberal win in 1989. Parties in Quebec require only 63 seats to ensure a majority win.</p>



<p>The CAQ was founded in 2011 and styles itself as the ideal party to build the province’s economy, improve the health-care system and protect the prominence of the French language in Quebec.</p>



<p>Additionally, immigration has been a widely discussed topic this election as a principal component of reducing Quebec’s current labour shortage. Like the rest of Canada, Quebec’s population is aging, and the birth rate is low, leading to large gaps in the provincial workforce.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.canadavisa.com/assess/canada-immigration-assessment-form.htm?utm_source=CICNews&amp;utm_medium=Article&amp;utm_campaign=CIC-20221004CAQ" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Discover if You Are Eligible for Canadian Immigration</a></p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Immigration reforms during last term</h3>



<p>Immigration is a shared responsibility between the federal and provincial governments. However,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.canadavisa.com/quebec-skilled-immigration.html">Quebec</a>&nbsp;is the only province in Canada that has complete control over the selection of economic immigrants. Over the past four years, the CAQ has prioritized immigrants from French-speaking countries in order to maintain Quebec’s unique cultural status within Canada as the only francophone province.</p>



<p>Each year Quebec releases its own&nbsp;<a href="https://www.canadavisa.com/canada-immigration-levels-plans.html">Immigration Levels Plan</a>&nbsp;that will set the target for the number of new immigrants that province is willing to invite. The 2022 plan calls for between 49,500 and 52,200 immigrants across all categories.</p>



<p>With a maximum target of 33,900, the economic category represents the largest proportion of newcomers. In this category, the province expects to welcome up to 28,800 skilled workers and up to 4,300 business immigrants, which would include investors, entrepreneurs, and the self-employed.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Changing immigration targets</h3>



<p>Additionally, as a temporary measure to make up for not reaching 2020 targets, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cicnews.com/2021/10/quebec-sets-admissions-target-of-52500-immigrants-for-2022-1019420.html">province committed to admitting a further 18,000 immigrant this year</a>. This means that by the end of 2022, Quebec could welcome more than 70,000 newcomers.</p>



<p>This is a dramatic change from&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cicnews.com/2018/12/quebec-sets-admissions-target-of-40000-new-permanent-residents-for-2019-1211547.html">CAQ’s 2019 immigration levels plan</a>&nbsp;in which targets were reduced by 20% to improve the selection and francization of newcomers to Quebec.</p>



<p>Since CAQ lowered admission targets, the Quebec government has focused on the integration and francization of all new permanent residents by making significant investments in this area. For example, The budget for 2022-2023 cites investments of $290 million to increase support for immigrants to learn French, attract immigrants to regions outside Montreal, and expedite the processing of immigration applications.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Immigration reforms to come</h3>



<p>Legault has committed to allowing only 50,000 newcomers into Quebec a year throughout his term. He says this is the largest number of immigrants Quebec can accommodate as it is difficult to integrate newcomers into Quebec society, particularly those who need to learn French. One of the main pillars of the CAQ party is to protect the French language in Quebec.</p>



<p>The CAQ is also advocating for control over the selection of family class immigrants, who make up 11,000 of the immigrants Quebec plans to admit. Currently, the federal government decides who can immigrate as a family class immigrant and has refused to grant this power to Quebec.</p>



<p>Earlier this year, the CAQ introduced Bill-96, a law that limits the use of English in courts and public services in Quebec. The bill has faced criticism due to a clause stating that newcomers to Quebec are only able to access public services, such as hospitals, in English for six months after they arrive in the province.</p>



<p>The bill is currently being debated in the courts.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">The Canadian government is expected to announce the latest Immigration Levels Plan by November 1, 2022.</h4>



<p>Each year&nbsp;<a href="https://www.canadavisa.com/ircc.html">Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada</a>&nbsp;(IRCC) releases an<a href="https://www.canadavisa.com/canada-immigration-levels-plans.html">&nbsp;Immigration Levels Plan</a>&nbsp;that acts as the guideline for how many immigrants will be allowed to come to Canada each year. It includes the breakdown of immigrants from economic class, family class and humanitarian class programs over the next three years. This year it will show projections for 2023, 2024 and 2025.</p>



<p>The government must make this announcement by November 1 of each year, as per the&nbsp;<a href="https://laws.justice.gc.ca/PDF/I-2.5.pdf">Immigration and Refugee Protection Act</a>&nbsp;(IRPA), which is Canada’s main immigration law. It is the second Immigration Levels Plan announced in 2022,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cicnews.com/2022/01/canada-to-announce-immigration-levels-plan-2022-2024-by-february-0121114.html#gs.d7jbvh">the first occurred in February</a>&nbsp;after the most recent federal election on September 20, 2021.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.canadavisa.com/assess/canada-immigration-assessment-form.htm?utm_source=CICNews&amp;utm_medium=Article&amp;utm_campaign=CIC-20220922Plan" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Discover if You Are Eligible for Canadian Immigration</a></p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Why are there two announcements this year?</h3>



<p>The 2022-2024 plan was not announced until February 2022 instead of the normally scheduled one due by November 1, 2021.</p>



<p>After the election, Parliament did not resume until November 22, 2021, after which it only sat for 19 days until the holiday break began. In these situations, according to IRPA, the plan must be announced within 30 days of Parliament reconvening. In this case, Parliament resumed in mid-January 2022.</p>



<p>Now that Parliament is in full swing, the government will proceed with releasing the newest Immigration Levels Plan on its regular schedule.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">The current Immigration Levels Plan</h3>



<p>Under the<a href="https://www.canadavisa.com/canada-immigration-levels-plans.html">&nbsp;Immigration Levels Plan for 2022-2024</a>, Canada has been targeting to bring 431,645 new permanent residents total through all immigration classes in 2022. This target steadily increases into 2024 for a total of 451,000 new permanent residents.</p>



<p>So far in 2022&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cicnews.com/2022/09/canada-is-on-track-to-welcome-a-record-431000-immigrants-0930447.html#gs.d7ji4g">Canada has already welcomed over 300,000 new permanent residents</a>. Most of them are from economic class programs. The target for economic class immigrants in 2022 is 241,850, or approximately 60% of the total number of immigrants. The 2022 plan also targets 105,000 family class immigrants and 8,250 from the refugee and humanitarian class.</p>



<p>Once the new Immigration levels Plan for 2023-2025 is announced, these targets may all change and are no longer used as the reference point for IRCC immigration targets.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">What to expect?</h3>



<p>Typically, the<a href="https://www.canadavisa.com/canada-immigration-levels-plans.html">&nbsp;Immigration Levels Plan</a>&nbsp;contains new increases, and are currently at their highest levels ever. For example, less than 10 years ago the total target for 2016 was 250,000 immigrants. In 2021, IRCC broke the record for the largest number of permanent residents ever, totaling over 405,000 even during uncertainty brought by the pandemic.</p>



<p>The current overall target for 2023 stands at 447,055 before a very modest increase to 451,000 in 2024.</p>



<p>IRCC works with various other governmental departments and stakeholders to create an Immigration Levels Plan that is balanced in how permanent resident’ spots are allocated in each class and subsequent program.</p>



<p>In June, in an interview with&nbsp;<em>CIC News</em>, Immigration Minister Sean Fraser said he would consult with the provinces to better understand their labour market needs as&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cicnews.com/2022/08/analysis-canadas-provinces-are-seeking-a-new-deal-on-immigration-0829596.html#gs.d7jss6">some provincial immigration ministers have criticized the current plan</a>&nbsp;for not allocating enough spots to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.canadavisa.com/provincial-nomination-program.html">Provincial Nomination Programs</a>&nbsp;(PNPs), which they believe are better suited to target the skilled immigrants required to bolster the workforce and make up for shortfalls in Canada’s labour force.</p>



<p>The minister also said that he can&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cicnews.com/2022/06/will-canada-welcome-over-500000-new-immigrants-per-year-0626644.html#gs.d77h0t">foresee targets going as high as 500,000</a>&nbsp;new permanent residents a year in the coming years. However, he did not specify when.</p>



<p>“Look, I wouldn’t put it on the clock,” he said. “I think we will get there. We’re growing in excess of 1% of our population through the existing track. That trajectory is going to continue. I don’t know the exact year we’re going to cross that threshold [500,000 immigrants per year]. It’s going to be based on the needs of communities.”</p>



<p><a href="https://www.cicnews.com/2022/09/canadas-immigration-backlog-decreases-slightly-to-2-6-million-0930997.html#gs.d7jwxh">Based on data from IRCC, as of August 31</a>, there are 513, 923 applications for permanent residency waiting to be processed. IRCC recently announced that it was&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cicnews.com/2022/09/fraser-announces-new-measures-to-modernize-canadas-immigration-system-0930385.html#gs.d7jyyd">working to improve client services and speed up processing time</a>&nbsp;by hiring over 1,000 new employees, moving to a 100% digital application process, and overall making investments to modernize the aging technology that the department relies on.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Why is Canada welcoming more immigrants?</h3>



<p><a href="https://www.canadavisa.com/canada-immigration-levels-plans.html">The Immigration Levels Plan</a>&nbsp;is created by IRCC, in consultation with several governmental departments, to support the IRCC mandate to welcome and support immigrants in order to grow the economy, reunite families and provide humanitarian assistance.</p>



<p>New immigrants are especially vital to Canada’s economy because they contribute through their labour and by paying income tax. For instance, these taxes are meant to support infrastructure, healthcare, education, pensions and more. Canada’s population is aging and baby boomers, those born between 1946 and the early 1960s, are reaching the retirement age of 65. An increased number of immigrants will help Canada maintain its high living standards.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">A Labour Market Impact Assessment (LMIA) is generally required for a foreign national to work in Canada. In certain situations, however, the LMIA requirement can be waived if the person offers a significant benefit to Canada.</h4>



<p>A Labour Market Impact Assessment (LMIA) is generally required for a foreign national to work in Canada. In certain situations, however, the LMIA requirement can be waived if the person offers a significant benefit to Canada.</p>



<p>As a result, a <a href="https://www.canadavisa.com/labour-market-impact-assessments.html">Labour Market Impact Assessment</a> (LMIA) is generally required. The LMIA requirement, however, can be waived under a ‘significant benefit’ exemption. In such cases, the positive effects of the issuance of a <a href="https://www.canadavisa.com/working-in-canada.html">work permit</a>, would outweigh the potential negative consequences that could result from the standard procedure not being followed.</p>



<p>These are cases for which an LMIA is usually required but practical considerations prevent this from being a possibility if Canada is to benefit, usually due to the lengthy processing times associated with most LMIAs. In such cases, aside from the lack of LMIA, the other factors that are typically considered when assessing a work permit application would mitigate in favour of the work permit being granted. Such factors include the potential impact on investment in Canada and the country’s economy, the disruption of the Canadian labor market, as well as the needs of the Canadian consumer.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Criteria for a significant benefit work permit</h4>



<p>Foreign nationals looking to get a significant work permit in Canada must demonstrate to the Canadian government the work they will do will have a significant economic, social, or cultural benefit to Canada. The applicant will need to show they have a record of distinction in their field.</p>



<p>According to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.canadavisa.com/immigration-refugees-and-citizenship-canada-ircc.html#gs.48f1dc">Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC),</a>&nbsp;the criteria that the Canadian government considers when deciding whether to issue a work permit includes:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list"><li>official academic documentation showing that the foreign worker has obtained educational credentials related to their professional area of expertise;</li><li>documented evidence from current or past employers that shows the foreign worker has significant full time experience in the job (significant is defined as ten or more years of work experience);</li><li>has been the recipient of international or national awards or patents;</li><li>membership in organizations that require excellence of its members;</li><li>have held a position where they have judged the work of others;</li><li>proof that their work, achievements, and contributions to their field has been recognized by peers, the government, or professional associations;</li><li>proof of scientific or scholarly contributions to their field;</li><li>publications by the foreign national in academic or industry publications;</li><li>foreign worker served in a leadership role in an organization with a distinguished reputation;</li><li>foreign workers who are foreign workers destined outside of Quebec in a job with a National Occupation Classification 0, A and B, recruited through&nbsp;<em>Destination Canada</em>&nbsp;or other job fairs that were coordinated with the federal government and francophone&nbsp;minority communities.</li></ul>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Who Can Get a Significant Benefit Work Permit?</h4>



<p>The following are among those eligible to get a significant benefit work permit:</p>



<p><strong><a href="https://www.canadavisa.com/intra-company-transfer-program.html">Intra-Company Transferees</a></strong></p>



<p>A significant benefit work permit may be available to a foreign national employed by a multi-national company that is seeking entry to Canada to work for a parent, subsidiary, or branch of that company. The position they are being transferred to in Canada must be in an&nbsp;executive, senior managerial, or specialized knowledge role.</p>



<p><strong><a href="https://www.canadavisa.com/television-and-film-production-workers.html">Television and Film Production&nbsp;Workers</a></strong></p>



<p>Workers in the TV and film industry whose role is essential to the production may be eligible to obtain a significant benefit work permit. According to IRCC, admitting such workers helps to attract investment to Canada and creates significant economic benefits for Canadian citizens and permanent residents.</p>



<p><strong><a href="https://www.canadavisa.com/temporary-work-permits-for-entrepreneurs.html">Entrepreneurs and Self-Employed Workers</a></strong></p>



<p>Those looking to start a business in Canada or be self-employed may be able to get a significant benefit work permit. They need to show the Canadian government their activities in Canada will result in an economic, social, or cultural benefit.</p>



<p><strong><a href="https://www.canadavisa.com/canada-emergency-repair-service-visa.html">Emergency Repair Personnel&nbsp;</a></strong></p>



<p>These are workers who are needed in Canada to conduct emergency repairs to industrial or commercial equipment, even under warranty, to prevent the disruption of employment in Canada.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">The next month will hold announcements for the Parents and Grandparents Program, Immigration Levels Plan 2023-2025, Statistics Canada census data and more.</h4>



<p>The coming month is likely to be a busy one for Canada’s immigration sector. There are several end-of-year developments expected in the coming weeks that will lay a foundation for immigration targets and trends for the next year and beyond.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.canadavisa.com/ircc.html">Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada&nbsp;</a>(IRCC) will announce the process for the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.canadavisa.com/parent-and-grandparent-sponsorship.html">PGP 2022</a>&nbsp;in late October and the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.canadavisa.com/parent-and-grandparent-sponsorship.html">Immigration Levels Plan 2023-2025</a>&nbsp;will be announced by November 1. Additionally, Statistics Canada will publish census data on immigration from 2021, the first time in five years.</p>



<p>It is also likely that the minimum&nbsp;<a href="https://www.canadavisa.com/express-entry-comprehensive-ranking-system.html">Comprehensive Ranking System</a>&nbsp;(CRS) score for the newly resumed all-program&nbsp;<a href="https://www.canadavisa.com/express-entry.html">Express Entry</a>&nbsp;draws will continue to decrease until it is below 500, as was the norm before the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Parents and Grandparents Program 2022</h4>



<p>On September 6, IRCC told&nbsp;<em>CIC News</em>&nbsp;in an email that the application intake will be available in the coming weeks for the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.canadavisa.com/parent-and-grandparent-sponsorship.html">Parents and Grandparents Program</a>&nbsp;(PGP).</p>



<p>Under this program, applicants can sponsor their parents or grandparents for immigration to Canada. In past years, IRCC has decided which parents and grandparents will be eligible for a visa by lottery. However, it remains unconfirmed whether this will also be the case this year and IRCC will unveil the process as part of the announcement.</p>

However, it remains unconfirmed whether this will also be the case this year and IRCC will unveil the process as part of the announcement.</p>



<p>In&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cicnews.com/2021/07/pgp-2021-canada-to-share-parents-and-grandparents-details-tomorrow-0718656.html#gs.e0l3tf">2021</a>, IRCC held a lottery for the PGP that invited 30,000 Canadians to submit their applications to sponsor. Last year’s figure was higher to compensate for the lower figure in 2020. Due to the onset of the pandemic, IRCC only allowed 10,000 sponsors to apply for the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cicnews.com/2020/10/what-do-you-need-to-be-eligible-for-the-pgp-2020-1016018.html#gs.e0ie97">PGP in 2020</a>.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">2021 Census Report</h4>



<p>Every five years Statistics Canada releases detailed data on immigration. The last time census data on immigration was released was in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cicnews.com/2017/02/census-immigration-accounted-two-thirds-canada-population-growth-since-2011-028878.html#gs.e0j07v">October 2017</a>.</p>



<p>Statistics Canada collects data from all Canadians every year to better understand how Canadians live. For example, their income brackets, how many people they live with, and languages spoken, among other factors. This data is used by the government to better assess the real living conditions of Canadians to better anticipate their needs.</p>

For example, their income brackets, how many people they live with, and languages spoken, among other factors.

<p>The data will be made public in the last week of October.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Express Entry CRS score may drop below 500</h4>



<p>IRCC resumed all-program&nbsp;<a href="https://www.canadavisa.com/express-entry.html">Express Entry</a>&nbsp;draws last July after a hiatus of over 18 months. The&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cicnews.com/2022/07/express-entry-canada-expected-to-invite-fswp-and-cec-candidates-today-0726782.html#gs.e0lucr">initial draw on July 6</a>&nbsp;invited 1,500 candidates to apply for permanent residence, with a minimum&nbsp;<a href="https://www.canadavisa.com/express-entry-comprehensive-ranking-system.html">Comprehensive Ranking System</a>&nbsp;score of 557.</p>



<p>Since July 6, the minimum CRS has been steadily decreasing with each draw. The first five draws had declines of 8 or 9 points and the two most recent draws on&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cicnews.com/2022/09/canada-holds-sixth-all-program-express-entry-draw-since-july-0930714.html#gs.e0lzjn">September 14</a>&nbsp;and 28 had decreased of only 6 points in each draw. The&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cicnews.com/2022/09/canada-invites-candidates-in-the-most-recent-express-entry-draw-0931156.html#gs.e0lr1w">most recent score on September 28</a>&nbsp;was 504. If this trend continues, the score could soon dip below 500 for an all-program draw for the first time since the draw on December 23, 2020, when the CRS score was 468.</p>



<p>While the score is slowly decreasing, compared to draws before the pandemic, 504 is still a remarkably high. A typical draw before the pandemic would have a CRS score between 450 and 500 points.</p>



<p>As the CRS score continues to lower, the number of ITAs has also been increasing with each draw. Again, the first several draws saw an increase of 250 candidates with each draw until the most recent three draws in which the number of ITA’s has jumped by 500 each draw. All-program draws in 2020 before the pandemic invited between 3,400- 4,500 candidates each time.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Immigration Levels Plan 2023-2025</h4>



<p>Each year IRCC issues an&nbsp;<a href="https://www.canadavisa.com/canada-immigration-levels-plans.html">Immigration Levels Plan</a>&nbsp;to act as the guideline for the number of immigrants that will be allowed to come to Canada each year. It includes the breakdown of immigrants from economic class, family class and humanitarian class programs over the next three years.</p>



<p>This year it looks like IRCC is poised to set more record-breaking targets. The target for 2022 is nearly 432,000 new permanent residents and over 451,000 by 2024.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.canadavisa.com/canadas-immigration-minister.html">Immigration Minister Sean Fraser</a>&nbsp;<a href="https://www.canadavisa.com/canada-immigration-levels-plans.html">told&nbsp;<em>CIC News</em>&nbsp;in June</a>&nbsp;that he can foresee higher targets in the coming years, up to 500,000 new permanent residents, but he did not specify when that would happen. It is unlikely the target will decrease given Canada’s current labour shortage and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cicnews.com/2022/09/canadian-job-vacancies-have-reached-another-all-time-high-0930962.html#gs.e0mfd1">high number of job vacancies</a>.</p>



<p>According to the Immigration Refugees Protection Act (IRPA), IRCC has a deadline of November 1 to release the new plan but as Parliament is sitting for four consecutive weeks after Canadian Thanksgiving, it is possible that the plan may come a few days sooner. IRPA is the main piece of legislation that regulates Canadian immigration.</p>



<p>IRCC works with other governmental departments and stakeholders to create an Immigration Levels Plan that is balanced in how permanent resident’ spots are distributed among each immigration class, and from there further organized into how many spots per program.</p>
